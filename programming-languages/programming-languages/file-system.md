"""# Google Drive

You can access files in Drive in a number of ways, including:
- Mounting your Google Drive in the runtime's virtual machine
- Using a wrapper around the API such as [PyDrive](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/)
- Using the [native REST API](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-sdk)



Examples of each are below.

## Mounting Google Drive locally

The example below shows how to mount your Google Drive on your runtime using an authorization code, and how to write and read files there. Once executed, you will be able to see the new file (`foo.txt`) at [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/).

This only supports reading, writing, and moving files; to programmatically modify sharing settings or other metadata, use one of the other options below.

**Note:** When using the 'Mount Drive' button in the file browser, no authentication codes are necessary for notebooks that have only been edited by the current user.
